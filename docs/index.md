# Configure with `confidence` ðŸ˜Ž

Confidence does two things: it helps loading configuration options from file(s) and presents those options as a user-friendly object at runtime.
Inspired by the way Python's own ``pip`` reads its configuration (try ``pip config debug`` if you're not familiar with ``pip``'s configuration),
confidence uses a similarly flexible, but deterministic approach to combining information from multiple configuration files.
If that sounds awfully complicated, there's no requirement that you need to use anything that feels complicated.

As a quick overview, confidence contains the following features:

- a dict-like `Configuration` object supporting attribute access to configured values;
- customizable loading of multiple sources (files, environment variables, â€¦) into a single object with deterministic precedence of those sources;
- the ability to make and resolve references to values or entire namespaces.
