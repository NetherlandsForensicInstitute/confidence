Configure with confidence
=========================

Confidence does two things: it helps loading configuration options from file(s) and presents those options as a user-friendly object at runtime.
Inspired by the way Python's own ``pip`` reads its configuration (try ``pip config debug`` if you're not familiar with ``pip``'s configuration),
confidence uses a similarly flexible, but deterministic approach to combining information from multiple configuration files.
If that sounds awfully complicated, there's no requirement that you need to use anything that feels complicated.
See the :ref:`examples <examples>`, ranging from very simple to more complex uses of confidence' capabilities.
